# Individual Student Analytics Implementation Plan

## Steps to Complete:

1. **Backend Changes (app.py)**
   - [x] Add new endpoint `/analytics/<student_name>` to fetch analytics for specific student
   - [x] Implement logic to filter data by student name and return individual analytics

2. **Frontend Changes (Students.jsx)**
   - [x] Add student selection functionality (click handler on student rows)
   - [x] Add state to track selected student
   - [x] Add button/link to navigate to analytics with selected student
   - [x] Pass selected student data to analytics component

3. **Frontend Changes (Analytics.jsx)**
   - [x] Modify to accept student parameter for individual analytics
   - [x] Update fetch logic to use individual student endpoint when student is selected
   - [x] Add more graph types for detailed individual analysis
   - [x] Ensure proper error handling for student not found

4. **Routing Changes (App.jsx)**
   - [x] Add route for individual student analytics

5. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test backend endpoint with various student names
   - [ ] Test frontend navigation and data display
   - [ ] Verify all graph types render correctly

## Additional Graph Types Added:
- [x] Line chart for performance trend over time
- [x] Radar chart for subject comparison
- [x] Scatter plot for correlation analysis
- [x] Detailed performance metrics cards
- [x] Student information panel

## Next Steps:
- Start the backend server to test the new endpoint
- Start the frontend to test the navigation and data display
- Verify all functionality works as expected
